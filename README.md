A simple web tool to compute the checksum of some text or small files. \
All checksums are computed locally using [node-forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge).

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.


<!-- 
Todo:
- Compute checksums in web workers. 
- Add the option to paste a checksum and verify it against the input.
- Add an option to copy the checksum to the clipboard.
- Add the ability to load multiple files and compute their checksums.
